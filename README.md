## 03-Javascript Assignment Two (Word Guessing Game - Beer Style Edition) - Challenge
...........................................................................................................

### Overview
VERSION 1 - 09.19.2019 (non-working)
In this assignment, I've begun the creation of a compelling and comprehensive computer game utilizing Javascript, CSS, and HTML that will allow users to guess Beer Styles.

JavaScript allows us to dynamically generate HTML and CSS based on predetermined conditions or user input.
1. When complete this app runs in the browser, and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code. 
2. Essentially, the app randomly picks a beer style, and the user has to guess letters of the beer style the app chose.
3. Future development will include corresponding images reflecting the style, region, and historcial data for each style -- A learning game.
